        <h1> Introduction </h1>
        <p> HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It’s a combination of Hypertext, which defines the link between web pages, and Markup language, which is used to define the text document within tags to structure web pages. This language is used to annotate text so that machines can understand and manipulate it accordingly. HTML is human-readable and uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. This guide will help you understand the workings of HTML and explain it with examples.</p>
        <h2> ML </h2>
        <p> Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. This article explores the concept of machine learning, providing various definitions and discussing its applications. The article also dives into different classifications of machine learning tasks, giving you a comprehensive understanding of this powerful technology.</p>
        <h3> Types </h3>
        <p>1. Supervised machine learning </p>
        <p>2. Unsupervised machine learning</p>
        <p>3. Semi-supervised learning</p>
        <p>4. Reinforcement leaning</p>
        <h4> Advantage </h4>
        <p>1. Computational Linguistics or Natural Language Processing (NPL)</p>
        <p>2. Image Recognition</p>
        </p>3. Speech Recognition</p>
        </p>4. Data Mining</p>
        <h5> Disadvantage </h5>
        <p>1. High error chances</p>
        <p>2. High usage of time and resources</p>
        <p>3. Decrease in jobs</p>
        <p>4. Highly expensive</p>

        <h6> Feature </h6>
        <p>Supervised learning: This involves training a model on a labeled data set, where the correct output is provided for each input. The algorithm uses this information to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs and can then make predictions on new, unseen data.</p>
        <p>Unsupervised learning: This involves training a model on an unlabeled data set where the correct output is not provided. The algorithm must find the structure in the data on its own and is typically used for clustering, dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection.</p>
        <p>Reinforcement learning: This involves training an agent to make decisions in an environment where it receives feedback through rewards or punishments. The algorithm uses this feedback to learn the best strategy for maximizing rewards over time. </p>

                <h1> Corruption</h1>
                <p> Corruption is the misuse of public property, position, power and authority for fulfilling the selfish purposes to gain personal satisfactions. Corruption is the misuse of authority for personal gain of an individual or group. It is the unfair use of public power for some private advantages by breaking some rules and regulations made by government. Now a day, it has been spread deeply in the society and has become very strong because of its lots of roots. It is like a cancer which once generated cannot be ended without medicine and spreading its roots continuously.

                    One common form of corruption in our country is receiving cash money, through online transfer or in the form of costly gift etc. Some people wrongly uses someone else money for their own sake. Some people recruited in the government or non-government offices have been involved in the corruption and can do anything to fulfil their wishes.
                    
                    The saying goes, “It’s a problem that affects everyone, from the least wealthy to the wealthiest. Corruption in India comes in different forms, like giving and taking bribes, stealing money, favoritism, and misusing public resources. The main reason for corruption in India is the absence of clear rules, responsibility, and a strong legal system.</p>

                <h1> Women empowerment </h1>
                <p> Women's empowerment (or female empowerment) may be defined in several ways, including accepting women's viewpoints, making an effort to seek them and raising the status of women through education, awareness, literacy, and training.[1][2][3] Women's empowerment equips and allows women to make life-determining decisions through the different societal problems.[3] They may have the opportunity to re-define gender roles or other such roles, which allow them more freedom to pursue desired goals.</p>
